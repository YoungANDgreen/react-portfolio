            <p>
                As a developer my main goal is to create software that has purpose. While creating content that is enjoyable has a very
                important place within development my mission is to create content that functions as a custom crafted tool.
                I became a developer to chase my own ambitions to build applications that solve problems within my industry along with
                within my community. One of my passions is applying my traditional training in Economics to tackle issues I believe can be
                solved together in order to strenghten our community. As the saying goes "A rising tide lifts all boats." and I believe
                that this sentiment is at the core of not only macro issues to be taken up by a community but also a guiding principle to live by
                when working within a team structure. The tenants of agile development embody this principle albeit through different language; but no matter
                the syntax all roads lead to Damascus. Thank you for taking the time to come visit my portfolio and if you have made it this far
                thank you for coming to my digital "Ted Talk".
